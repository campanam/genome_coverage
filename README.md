## Michael G. Campana, 2017  

Script to calculate genome sequencing coverage (mean +- standard deviation) from a BEDGRAPH (bga). Outputs a coverage histogram so that highly covered areas can be identified.  

### Installation

`git clone https://github.com/campanam/genome_coverage/`  
`chmod +x genome_coverage.rb`  
`[sudo] mv genome_coverage.rb [DESTINATION]`  

### Execution  
Enter command:  
`ruby genome_coverage.rb`
Give input file name and output histogram name at the prompts. Coverage histogram will be written to the given output name. Genome coverage values will be printed to standard output.
